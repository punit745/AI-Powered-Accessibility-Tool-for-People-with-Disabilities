# AI-Powered Accessibility Tool for People with Disabilities

This project is aimed at enabling accessibility for individuals with mobility challenges by replacing traditional input methods (e.g., mouse/keyboard) with an AI-powered system that uses eye tracking and blink gestures.

## Features
1. Real-time eye tracking using webcam.
2. Blink detection for gesture-based clicking.
3. Virtual keyboard controlled by eye movement or blinking.
4. Scalable user interface for accessibility.
